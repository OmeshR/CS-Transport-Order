<h1 style="color: orange;">CS Transportify</h1>
The Transport Order Automation Tool simplifies transport scheduling with a Python/Tkinter GUI, automating data entry into an Excel sheet by shift and route. 

## Project Overview
This Python and Tkinter application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing transport orders by filling in a predefined Excel table with passenger names and corresponding routes. The tool minimizes manual input by 89%, reducing human error and making the process repeatable and efficient. This project includes features to handle multiple shifts, store inputted data, clear past entries, and export a printable version.

8. Once you're done with adding people based on their shifts, click on "Save to Excel" to create an excel table with the transport order (This excel sheet will pop-up as soon as you hit "Save to Excel" (For any dialogue box that opens along with the excel sheet, just press on "okay")

9. Use the temporarily created excel sheet to send out the transport order to the cab company. REFER BELOW TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION WILl BE ADDED AUTOMATICALLY.
10. 
Marked in blue = Date, Prepared by, Total Cabs will be automatically added.

Marked in green = Route will be automatically added based on the name.

Marked in yellow = No. of passengers will be automatically calculated based on how many passengers are there on the same route.

Marked in red = vehicle type and time to arrive/leave will be automatically added based on the type of shift.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** `Please read this section carefully before proceeding.`

Make sure that you have Microsoft Excel as an desktop application in your PC.
As you can see below, the default program for opening "Route" and "Uptime" is Microsoft Excel. Please make sure that in your newly acquired "Transportify version 11", these two files are also shown with an Microsoft Excel icon.

Based on the passenger's name, the route will be automatically added in front of their name.

If there are two or more passengers with the same route, the program will add them to the same transport.

Based on the number of people in one route, the program will add either "1" or "2" or "3" to the "No. of Passengers" column.

Based on the day you're working on this, the date will be automatically added.

Based on the number of routes, the program will automatically calculate the "No. of cabs" and print the sum on the table.

The name of the person who made the transport order can be selected before clicking on "Save to Excel" and that will be printed on the table too.

Please keep your internet connection active when using the tool as it is needed to find the correct date. The date will be added after adding +1 to today's date because the transport order is sent for tomorrow.
