The Transport Order Automation Tool simplifies transport scheduling with a Python/Tkinter GUI, automating data entry into an Excel sheet by shift and route. 

## Project Overview
This Python and Tkinter application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing transport orders by filling in a predefined Excel table with passenger names and corresponding routes. The tool minimizes manual input by 89%, reducing human error and making the process repeatable and efficient. This project includes features to handle multiple shifts, store inputted data, clear past entries, and export a printable version.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** `Please read this section carefully before proceeding.`

Based on the passenger's name, the route will be automatically added in front of their name.

If there are two or more passengers with the same route, the program will add them to the same transport.

Based on the number of people in one route, the program will add either "1" or "2" or "3" to the "No. of Passengers" column.

Based on the day you're working on this, the date will be automatically added.

Based on the number of routes, the program will automatically calculate the "No. of cabs" and print the sum on the table.

The name of the person who made the transport order can be selected before clicking on "Generate" and that will be printed on the table too.

Please keep your internet connection active when using the tool as it is needed to find the correct date.
