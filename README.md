# CS-Transport-Order
The Transport Order Automation Tool simplifies transport scheduling with a Python/Tkinter GUI, automating data entry into an Excel sheet by shift and route. 

Project Overview
This Python and Tkinter application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing transport orders by filling in a predefined Excel table with passenger names and corresponding routes. The tool minimizes manual input by 89%, reducing human error and making the process repeatable and efficient. This project includes features to handle multiple shifts, store inputted data, clear past entries, and export a printable version.
